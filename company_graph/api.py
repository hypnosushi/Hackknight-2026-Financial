"""F9. Graph API: the two endpoints the Company Graph page polls.

    GET /graph/{ticker}                -> schemas.GraphResponse
    GET /graph/{ticker}/board          -> schemas.BoardResponse
    GET /graph/{ticker}/news/{other}   -> schemas.PairNewsResponse (F13, pair_news)
    GET /companies/search?q=           -> up to 10 {symbol, name}

Mounted in backend/main.py with `app.include_router(company_graph.api.router)`.

GET /graph/{ticker} returns the stored links at once and never waits for SEC or the model.
Its `status`:
  - "done": the last link run is done and newer than GRAPH_LINK_TTL_DAYS (links.is_fresh).
  - "running": a run for this company is going (a task in this process, or a `running` row
    another process wrote less than 10 minutes ago), or this request just started one.
  - "error": the last run ended in error less than ERROR_RETRY_S ago. Whatever links exist are
    still returned. After ERROR_RETRY_S a new request starts a new run, so an outage is retried.
  - Otherwise (no run yet, links older than the TTL, a crashed `running` row, an old error) the
    request starts `links.build_links` as an in-process asyncio task, with its own session
    (build_links commits as it goes), and answers "running".
At most one task per company runs in this process (`_RUNS`); across processes build_links
itself skips a company whose run is in progress.

Highlights are read from `graph_highlights` (newest first, only for the returned nodes, within
GRAPH_EVENT_WINDOW_DAYS). Once the links are done, `refresh_highlights` starts F8's
`highlights.build_highlights` as an in-process task with its own session (`run_session`):
  - at most one highlight task per company in this process (`_HIGHLIGHT_RUNS`);
  - at most once per GRAPH_NEWS_TTL_HOURS per company after a run that finished, or once per
    ERROR_RETRY_S after one that raised (`_HIGHLIGHTS_DONE`, in memory: a restart allows one new
    run, and F6's news cache and F8's evaluation file keep that cheap);
  - while it runs the response says "running" (with the links and the highlights stored so far),
    so the page keeps polling; then "done" with the new highlights.
A failure in highlight building is logged and never turns a good links graph into an error.

GET /graph/{ticker}/news/{other} answers only for a company `other` that is linked to `ticker` in the
stored graph (404 otherwise), so it cannot be used to spend NewsAPI and X requests on any pair. It
waits for pair_news (cached per pair for GRAPH_PAIR_TTL_HOURS; a new pair takes a few seconds).

GET /graph/{ticker}/board follows the same rules for the company's directors, with its own run
row (`graph_board_runs`), TTL (GRAPH_BOARD_TTL_DAYS) and tasks (`_BOARD_RUNS`): the stored members
at once, and `boards.build_board` in the background when there is no fresh run. A company with
no Form 3 / 4 filings is "done" with no members. It is a separate request so the page can draw
the links without waiting for it, and it never starts or delays a link or highlight run.

With GRAPH_FAKE=1 every endpoint serves the fixtures (pair news: no items) and touches no database
and no network.
