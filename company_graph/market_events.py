"""F7. Prediction market events: alerts from the alert detector, mapped to the companies they name.

Read-only on the teammates' tables: this module only SELECTs from `alerts` and `markets` and
never writes to them (nor to `market_prices`, `market_trades`, `market_hourly`,
`market_baselines`). It does not judge odds itself; an `alerts` row already means "a market
moved". It writes only this feature's tables: `entities` (via ensure_entity),
`market_entities` and `graph_events`.

Flow:
    read_recent_alerts(session, since)       -> AlertRow (alert joined with its markets row)
    alert_texts(row)                         -> market title, event title, outcome label
    find_companies(text, directory)          -> companies named in the text (pure, see below)
    match_alert(row, directory)              -> MarketEvent per named company (pure)
    save_market_events(session, events)      -> market_entities + graph_events rows
    fetch_market_events(symbols, session=..) -> all of the above for the last
                                                GRAPH_EVENT_WINDOW_DAYS

How company names are found (precision over recall; a missed market costs a highlight, a
false match puts a wrong highlight on the graph):
  * Text is split into word spans (up to 6 words) that never cross punctuation such as
    "?", ":", "," or parentheses. Longer spans are tried first, so "Apple Hospitality REIT"
    wins over "Apple".
  * A span must look like a proper noun: every word has a capital letter or a digit, except
    connectors ("and", "&", "of", "the", ...) inside the span. "apple pie" never matches.
  * Each span goes through companies.resolve, and the hit is kept only if the span's
    normalized form equals the company's normalized name. That throws away resolve's ticker
    paths, so "ON", "IT", "ALL", "KEY" or "Snow" can never match a company by its ticker.
    Names that two issuers share stay ambiguous (resolve returns None).
  * Tickers count only as cashtags ("$TSLA").
  * Single words need at least 3 characters (or a digit, as in "3M") and must not be in
    COMMON_WORDS: SEC names that are also everyday words in market titles ("Target", "Gold",
    "Visa", "Progressive", "Dow", "Strategy", ...). COMMON_PHRASES does the same for a few
    multi-word names ("Public Policy", "US Gold", "Five Below").
  * The team's seed aliases (backend/entities/data, e.g. "Google" -> GOOGL, "IBM", "AMD") are
    also tried, with the same rules; all-capital aliases must appear in capitals.
    EntityMatcher itself is not used: it also matches bare symbols case-insensitively, so
    "V" or "MA" would match almost any title.
