"""The one place this feature calls a free-form model (F4 extractor, F8 highlight builder).

Two providers, picked by GRAPH_LLM_PROVIDER:
- "openrouter" (default): the team's backend.llm.client.complete_structured, with the model
  from GRAPH_LLM_MODEL. Uses the OPENROUTER key.
- "anthropic": the Anthropic API directly through the official SDK, with the model from
  GRAPH_ANTHROPIC_MODEL. Uses ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. The reply is parsed into the Pydantic model
  with structured outputs, so it is always schema-valid JSON.

Synchronous either way: call it from async code through asyncio.to_thread. Every failure is
raised as backend.llm.client.LlmError, so callers handle both providers the same way.
