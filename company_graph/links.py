"""F5. Link finder: build one company's links from SEC filings and store them.

    result = await build_links("NVDA")                  # opens a session on DATABASE_URL
    links = await read_links(session, "NVDA")           # what the graph shows (F9)
    run = await get_link_run(session, "NVDA")           # running / done / error (F9 polls it)

One run, for the searched company S:
  1. Skip if `graph_link_runs` says the last run is `done` and newer than GRAPH_LINK_TTL_DAYS
     (no network call, not even the company directory when the ticker is given exactly).
     Otherwise mark it `running` and commit, so a poller sees it.
  2. One `list_filings` call (10-K and 8-K) gives S's SIC code, saved to
     `graph_company_profiles`, its latest 10-K and its 8-Ks from the last 90 days.
  3. Own 10-K: `trim_by_phrases`, then the companies named in each chunk (US-listed names
     found through the company directory, as F7 does for markets) are the subjects passed to
     `extract`, with S as the filer.
  4. Reverse lookup: `full_text_search` for S's short name in quotes, 10-Ks of the last 18
     months, top 10 filings by other filers. Each is trimmed with `trim_by_name` and read with
     the hit's company as the filer and S as the subject.
  5. 8-Ks: read, and kept only when they announce a material agreement or an acquisition
     (Item 1.01 or 2.01); same trim and extract as the own 10-K.
  6. A filing already in `graph_processed_filings` is skipped; each filing read is recorded.
  7. At most GRAPH_MAX_LINKED linked companies per run; suppliers and customers displace
     partners, competitors and sector peers that this run inserted.
  8. No link from filings at all: `sector_peer` links to companies already in
     `graph_company_profiles` with S's SIC code (often none; the page handles that).
  9. Mark the run `done`, or `error` with the message.

Direction (company_graph.md): a filing link is stored with the FILER as `entity_symbol`, and
`relationship_type` is the other company's role for the filer. So S's own filings give rows
(S -> X, type = X's role for S), and reverse hits give rows (filer X -> S, type = S's role for
X). Sector links are (S -> peer, sector_peer). `read_links` reads both directions and flips the
second with `reverse_type`, so every link comes back as "X is S's <type>". The same rows serve
X's graph too, and a link found from both sides is one row, not two.

Every evidence URL is a document fetched by this run's one SecClient (`fetched_urls`); the
sector fallback uses S's submissions JSON, fetched by `list_filings` in the same run.

Timing: documents are read in parallel (SEC requests share the client's limiter; model calls
run in threads, at most MAX_PARALLEL_MODEL_CALLS at a time). Only the main coroutine touches
the database, and it commits after each filing, so when the time budget (60 s) runs out the
unfinished reads are cancelled and everything already saved stays. Unfinished filings are not
recorded as read, so the next run tries them again.

build_links commits (it is a run, not a save function): status rows must be visible while the
run is going. The `session` it gets must therefore not be inside a caller's open transaction
that the caller wants to roll back.
