 * AAPL-specific tags, grounded in real, currently-live storylines (not
 * generic placeholders) so the mock demo reads as plausible rather than
 * obviously synthetic:
 * - CEO transition: John Ternus succeeded Tim Cook as CEO on 2026-09-01;
 *   Cook moved to executive chair. Ternus leads his first earnings call
 *   (fiscal Q4 FY26, reporting 2026-11-02) alongside CFO Kevan Parekh.
 * - "Year of AI" framing: Apple's July guidance projected September-quarter
 *   revenue growth of 9-11% YoY with iPhone revenue growing mid-teens; sell-
 *   side commentary (e.g. Wedbush) has framed 2026 as Apple's AI catch-up
 *   year after Siri/Apple Intelligence lagged competitors.
 * - App Store antitrust pressure and EU Digital Markets Act compliance
 *   remain live, ongoing regulatory threads independent of any one case.
 * - Supply chain diversification out of China (India/Vietnam assembly) is
 *   a multi-year, still-developing theme relevant to the supplier/consumer
 *   edges in the mock graph.
