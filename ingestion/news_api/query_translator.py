"""Translates a free-text user query into NewsQueryFilters, via the shared
LLM client. This is the only file in the codebase that knows how to
phrase NewsQueryFilters' fields as an LLM prompt — llm/client.py stays
generic, and a Kalshi/Twitter equivalent would get its own
query_translator.py here rather than extending this one, since their
filter shapes aren't full-text search at all.

This step is upstream of everything else in this package: it only
produces a NewsQueryFilters object, the same thing you'd construct by
hand. It doesn't call NewsAPI and doesn't touch entity matching.

Today's date (UTC) is {today}. Resolve relative dates ("last week", "past month") into absolute from_time/to_time values (ISO 8601).

Field guidance:
- keyword_query: bare search terms (NewsAPI effectively ORs these together). Use this for the general topic/subject.
- exact_phrases: only phrases the user wants matched exactly as written (e.g. a quoted phrase, a specific title).
- boolean_terms: only if the user explicitly describes AND/OR/NOT logic between terms (e.g. "Tesla or Rivian but not recalls"); otherwise leave null.
- language: ISO 639-1 code; default "en" unless the user names another language.
- domains / exclude_domains: only if the user names specific outlets/sites by name.
- sort_by: "relevancy" by default; "publishedAt" if the user asks for "latest"/"newest"/"most recent"; "popularity" if they ask for "most popular"/"most read".
- page_size: default 20 unless the user asks for a specific number (max 100, since NewsAPI caps it there).

A person or company name the user mentions should go into keyword_query or exact_phrases — it is NOT a separate field here, since this schema only controls what NewsAPI searches for, not how results get tagged afterward.

Leave every field you have no basis for at its default/empty value. Do not invent domains, dates, or boolean logic the user didn't ask for."""
